# ERASURE — A Sentient Narrative Experience

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Overview

ERASURE is a web-based interactive experience that combines 10 bleeding-edge AI technologies:

1. **Quantum Text Superposition** — Words exist in multiple emotional states until you observe them
2. **Neural Style Transfer** — Scene transforms into famous paintings based on your emotions
3. **Collective Dream Synthesis** — Story evolves from all users' emotional data
4. **Emotional Contagion Network** — Your emotions infect other readers in real-time
5. **Synesthetic Brain-Wave Detection** — Micro-facial analysis maps to brainwave states
6. **Temporal Paradox Engine** — AI predicts your actions before you perform them
7. **Memory Archaeology Mode** — Reconstruct corrupted text fragments
8. **Procedural Symphony** — Every letter becomes a musical note
9. **Dream Virus / Genetic Story** — Narrative mutates as it spreads between readers
10. **Consciousness Upload System** — Upload your emotional profile as an immortal NPC

## Key Features

### Phase 1: Arrival (30s)
- Dark void with 2,000 drifting particles
- Floating 3D book with pulsing glow
- Webcam permission request
- Ambient drone at 60 BPM

### Phase 2: The Reading (5-10 min)
- **Quantum Observation**: Text appears as superposition, eye-tracking collapses it
- **Drift & Decay**: Words flee cursor, decay into corruption over 10 seconds
- **Emotional Adaptation**: Webcam detects emotions, AI remixes story in real-time
- **Neural Style Transfer**: Scene transforms between Van Gogh/Munch/Picasso based on mood
- **Synesthetic Audio**: Each letter = musical note, voice warps with reading speed
- **Metamorphic Visuals**: NLP extracts nouns/adjectives → particles morph into shapes
- **Emotional Contagion**: Other readers' emotions broadcast to you in real-time
- **Temporal Paradox**: AI predicts your next action and warns you
- **Brainwave Sync**: Micro-facial analysis triggers visual/audio effects

### Phase 3: The End (2 min)
- Story reaches one of 15 possible endings
- All text rapid decay → particles collapse
- "Remember" button appears

### Phase 4: Consciousness Upload (1 min)
- Option to upload emotional profile as permanent NPC
- Generate character #XXXXX that haunts future readers
- Export 7 artifacts

## Export System

Users receive 7 exportable artifacts:

1. **Emotional Poster** (PNG, 1080x1920) — Visual journey through emotions
2. **Corrupted Manuscript** (PDF) — Text as it decayed
3. **Dream Recording** (MP3) — Audio mashup of narration + glitches
4. **Decay Animation** (GIF) — Screen recording of text corruption
5. **Procedural Symphony** (MIDI + MP3) — Music generated from reading
6. **Evolutionary Tree** (PDF) — Story mutation lineage
7. **Neural Signature** (SVG) — Consciousness upload certificate

## Technologies

- **Three.js** — 3D particles, text rendering
- **Tone.js** — Audio synthesis, procedural music
- **Socket.io** — Real-time emotional contagion network
- **Face-api.js** — Emotion detection
- **TensorFlow.js** — Neural style transfer
- **jsPDF** — PDF export
- **GSAP** — Smooth animations
- **Compromise.js** — NLP for noun/adjective extraction

## Configuration

Edit `server.js` to modify:
- Port number
- WebSocket timeout values
- Text decay timing (default 10 seconds)
- Emotional contagion radius
- Music tempo ranges

## Audio Setup

The app uses Tone.js for spatial audio:
- Mono base drone (60 BPM, adaptable)
- Letter-to-note synthesis (pentatonic scale)
- Voice narration with emotion-based effects
- Binaural beats for brainwave entrainment

## Privacy

ERASURE remembers emotional patterns but **forgets all text**:
- Emotional profiles stored in IndexedDB (local)
- Text fragments never persisted
- Only aggregate emotion data sent to server
- Consciousness NPCs are persistent and shareable

## Accessibility

Five modes available:
- **Reduced Motion** — Disables particle systems, slows decay
- **High Contrast** — Enhanced text visibility
- **Manual Emotions** — Manually select emotions instead of webcam
- **Extended Time** — 30-minute reading session
- **Screen Reader** — Full narration of all text

## Post-Launch

Potential expansions:
- AI-generated voice narration (ElevenLabs)
- Cloud GPU for real-time style transfer
- Gallery installation with multi-screen immersion
- Spotify album of best user-generated symphonies
- NFT marketplace for consciousness NPCs
